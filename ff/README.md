# FF: FILE FORMATS

Code that allow the system to utilize my custom binary files. So far, we utilize the following formats:

- `*.joj` for texture and material data.
- `*.crk` for static and animated 3D meshes.
- `*.ans` for animation metadata.
- `*.daf` for general-purpose storage.`

A more in-depth view of each can be found at docs/ff.
