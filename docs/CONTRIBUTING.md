# I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE!

 I don't expect you to, and you're insane if you do, so welcome aboard.

 The bulk of KVR is C99 and the preferred compiler is GCC. For a list of dependencies check README and STYLE to get a taste of what you're getting into.

### WHAT TO LOOK FOR

 There's never enough documentation. If you can help just describing the usage/arguments/return of a function that's highly appreciated.

 Aside from that, optimizations for `mamm` parse and interpreting code would be welcome; it's probably the toughest part of the project.

 Also porting missing SIN bits over from DSM ( /Liebranca/DSM/tree/dev/src/SIN ), reformatting and all, would be really nice.

 Final point, if you're interested in playing with PE$O scripts (for what little the language can do right now) it'd be pretty helpful if you found weirdness within the language (or rather, weirdness that's inconsistent with what's stated in /docs/PESOLANG.md ).

 Anything else small you can find or fix is cool as well, but those are the main things right now.

# FAQ && THINGS

### WAIT... THERE'S NO COC?

 Yeah those things bother me. Be cool and that's that.

 I don't like drama. I don't like most things, as a matter of fact. Do not use this repo as a vehicle for non-tech discussion or I'll ban you outright.

### ISSUES

 Don't report bugs unless you have absolutely no idea what is going on; then and only then I will look into it myself.

 Note that I only ever use issues as task lists when I feel like it, or else do it on a notepad file -- less flashy, but same thing. Feel free to do as I do: report what you're working at, make a list of things to look at, assign yourself and get to work.

### LICENSING

 I GPL3 into everything, that is my philosophy. If you have a problem with that for whichever reason then do the research yourself and pick a license that's compatible; it ultimately doesn't matter.

### LOOK AT MY BUGFIX

 No.

 I have my own schedule. If I can look at it then I will, else I won't. Don't nag me. If you grow too impatient just go ahead and fork.

### DOESN'T WORK ON X PLATFORM

 Then put in the details or I can't help you.

 Error messages, your specs, version of installed dependencies, your path variable, etc. Be descriptive or be ignored.

### FEATURE REQUESTS

 No.

 Alright, let me rephrase that: if you know something KVR is \_\_sorely\_\_ lacking then go ahead -- propose a way we could fix it. But don't ever try to invite in feature creep and additional bloat, it's just cringe.
