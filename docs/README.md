# KVR
 My own G-dam'n environment for coding C.

### What's in this repo?

 - Prototype of ESPECTRO shell and build system
 - KVR debug tooling
 - Pieces of `zjc`

### Why write libraries?

 - I have time
 - You \*need\* general public libraries
 - It's way more fun to write the deps rather than simply adding them
